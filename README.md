# 3D PRINTING JOURNEY WITH DARSTELLAR

*special thanks to my colleague, my friend, ***Trần Ngọc Duy*** (Lý Hoàng Duy), without whose support I couldn't have made it this far.*

This repo acts as a diary, or better called a journal that records my progress in the field of Reprap. The main purpose for the creation of this was to take notes on certain problems I was struck with, and the solutions and work-arounds that I came up with along the way. I was not aiming to become an expert in this vast field of 3D printing, but I do hope that this might help others on their journeys, even just a slight.
