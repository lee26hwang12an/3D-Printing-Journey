# ENCOUNTERED ISSUES WITH 3D PRINTING

*special thanks to my colleague, my friend, ***Trần Ngọc Duy*** (Lý Hoàng Duy), without whose support I couldn't have made it this far.*

## ***Nomenclature***
- Printer models are refered to as the ***first letter*** of its lineup, plus its ***number***, followed by some denotations according to the model's naming scheme.
- Example printer model for Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro: `n4pr`
- Example printer model for Creality Ender 5 Plus: `e5+`
- Example printer model for Elegoo Neptune 4 Max: `n4x`
- Example printer model for Bambulab X1 Carbon: `x1c`
- Date and time are refered to as combinations of 2-digit numbers: `HH-MM` `DD-MM-YY`
